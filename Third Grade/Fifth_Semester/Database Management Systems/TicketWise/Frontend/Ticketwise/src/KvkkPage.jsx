        Under the scope of Law No. 6698 on the Protection of Personal Data
        (“KVKK”), personal data refers to any information relating to an
        identified or identifiable natural person. According to KVKK provisions,
        the natural or legal person responsible for determining the purposes and
        means of processing personal data and managing the data recording system
        is defined as the data controller. In this context, your personal data

        name www.ticketwise.com (“Website”) and the Ticketwise mobile
        application (“Mobile Application”) will be processed by Ticketwise
        Information Systems Inc. (“Ticketwise”), as the data controller, within
